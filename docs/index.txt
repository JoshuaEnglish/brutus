Welcome to Stack VM's documentation!
====================================

Stack VM is an abstraction of a virtual machine. written in Python. 
It can be customized with specific rules the process the stack, and supports
reading and writing values from registers.

The goal is to have a simple engine that can be fed programs (plain text) and produce
results in the registers.

The register is a dictionary-like object that converts all keys to uppercase.

Stack VM supports labels, providing a mechanism for creating subroutines.

Stack VM provides a basic tokenizer to "compile" programs into the VM language. This
tokenizer could also help build higher level programs.
